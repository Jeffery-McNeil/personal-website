    <h1>Hello, im Jeff McNeil
        <h5>Just started coding.</h5>
    </h1>
    <div>
        <h3>Background:</h3>
            <p> Not to get too involved, but I grew up in a small town
            called "Quinlan, TX" east of Dallas, my high school graduating
            class was 37 people. I moved to Dallas when I could and have
            always spent a lot of time on computers in my free time. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I've attended multiple colleges in my moving around, attempting
            to get a degree, but it just wouldn't work for me. So I actually
            attended, and completed, technical school to be an automotive 
            mechanic. After spending four years doing that, I learned coding
            camps were a thing, and wanted to give them a try, I think the
            format will work better for me than traditional four year programs.
            </p>
        <h3>Goals:</h3>
            <P>I'd be happy to get any job coding, and I suspect I will
                have to to build up some experience, and possibly learn
                some additional languages, before I can go about getting
                a job making video games. My interest probably lie more in
                working with an indie team or something than a triple A, but
                I think either would be fun. 
            </P>
